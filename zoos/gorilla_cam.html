                        <p class="info-row-text">There are two species of gorilla, each containing two subspecies. The
                            two species are eastern and western, and the four sub-species are <a href="">Cross River</a>
                            and
                            <a href="">Western</a>
                            Lowland (are sub-species of the Western species) and Grauer’s and Mountain (are sub-species
                            of the Eastern species). Western gorillas can be distinguished from other gorilla <a
                                    href=""></a>subspecies</a>
                            by their brownish-gray hair, auburn-colored crests and overall smaller size. Eastern
                            gorillas tend to be black in color and larger in size. In all gorillas, males develop silver
                            coloration along their backs as they mature. The species is diurnal, which means they are
                            active during the day, and of all the great apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This
                            means that they primarily live on the ground, although they do <a href="">occasionally climb
                                trees</a> to
                            feed and nest. They are also able to stand on two legs for short periods of time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-row">
                        <h3 class="info-row-heading">Physical features and characteristics:</h3>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach physical maturity
                            between 12 and 15 years of age. Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as
                            much as females, weighing in between <a href="">150</a> and <a href="">250</a> pounds. Males
                            stand between 5.5 to 6 feet
                            tall. Females are a bit smaller, standing between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads are large
                            and pointed due to the sagittal crest that forms the back of the top of the head. This crest
                            serves as the foundation for attachment of a great number of jaw muscle fibers, which allows
                            for the chewing power needed to process tough vegetation.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas is similar to that
                            of humans. Gorillas have a prominent brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same as
                            humans. The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a gorilla’s nose, known as a noseprint,
                            are like human fingerprints, and every individual’s noseprint is unique. Researchers use these
                            noseprints as identification markers in their studies, both in zoological settings and in the wild.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used for defense and
                            breaking through vegetation. Their molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges that
                            facilitate chewing of tough plant fibers.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Gorillas’ faces, hands, and feet are bare, but the rest of their bodies
                            are covered with short, thin hair. Gorilla hands and feet are large, with leathery palms and
                            soles, and broad, flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up small, delicate
                            objects. Like their hands, their feet have opposable thumbs and toes. Like all apes,
                            gorillas’ arms are longer than their legs—a feature that allows them to walk on all fours.
                            They are called “knuckle-walkers,” meaning that they walk on the knuckles of their forelimbs
                            and the soles of their hind limbs. This form of locomotion develops calluses on the
                            knuckles, preserving the sensitivity of the fingertips necessary for <a
                                    href="">manipulating</a> smaller
                            objects.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-row with-ul">
                        <h3 class="info-row-heading">Lifestyle and reproduction:</h3>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Gorillas tend to be shy, peaceful creatures; they are not normally
                            aggressive to other animals unless provoked. However, if they are provoked, they can be
                            dangerous. They can demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived intruders.
                            Typically, they will not actually hit the intruder, but rush past, turn and then charge
                            again.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text pre-ul-text">Gorillas use a combination of vocalizations, visual signals and scents
                            to communicate. They are considered relatively quiet compared to other primates, but do have
                            at least <a href="">25 recognized</a> vocalizations, including:

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> • Hooting: Can carry for a mile through the forest and is usually accompanied by
                                display behavior such as chest beating, strutting, and vegetation slapping
                            </li>
                            <li> • Screams: Sounds of alarm or warning
                            </li>
                            <li> • Belches: Deep rumblings of contentment, comfort, or well-being
                            </li>
                            <li> • Sharp Grunts: Used when discipline is required
                            </li>
                            <li> • Whoop Barks: High-pitched barks denote curiosity
                            </li>
                            <li> • Bark Grunt: Aggression
                            </li>
                            <li> • Chuckles: Playfulness
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are similar to the cries
                            of a human baby. They will typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting in an immediate
                            response from the mother.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they use to
                            communicate with other troops and to maintain contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most
                            recognizable behavior performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done by male
                            gorillas at the end of a display meant to intimidate intruding males or predators. The sound
                            can be heard for long distances. Females will chest-beat infrequently; they will typically
                            beat their hands against the insides of their thighs. Chest-beating can also indicate
                            playful behavior, however, especially in the young. Young gorillas play much like humans do,
                            playing tag and doing somersaults.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known as troops. These
                            troops can consist of 5 to 30 individuals, although the average size is 11. The group is led
                            by a dominant silverback male and contains several adult females and their young. The
                            females will typically bond with the silverback, but not necessarily with each other. The
                            silverback will remain dominant for as long as he can defeat competing males.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">
                            There are several younger, blackback males that remain in the group until they are capable
                            of challenging the silverback. These young males are often driven out of the troop to
                            live a solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other bachelors until they
                            establish their own troops. If a dominant silverback is displaced, the new dominant
                            male will typically kill the infants in the troop, sending the females prematurely
                            into reproductive cycling. This increases the male’s chances of siring offspring, as
                            his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As such, females consider a male’s
                            ability to fight paramount to their offspring’s survival.
                        </p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">On maturing, females will also leave their natal group to join a lone
                            male or another small group. This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect the gene
                            pool.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, with the gorillas
                            bedding down for the night at sundown. The females and their offspring will build nests of
                            leaves and branches, while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the tree, in
                            order to protect his family. At Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, their indoor
                            areas are thoroughly cleaned; the walls and floors are scrubbed with <a
                                    href="">disinfectant</a>. The
                            gorillas are offered hay in their indoor area at night and nest with this material,
                            replicating natural behavior.</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">In a troop, the single silverback male will mate with the females,
                            siring all the offspring of the troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity between
                            7 and 8 years of age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of age, due to
                            competition. The potential breeding season is year-round and gestation typically takes 256
                            days, or about 8.5 months. Labor can last anywhere from one to 4 hours. Babies are usually
                            born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh between 3 and 5 pounds and are weaned around 2
                            to 3 years of age, but can be dependent on their mothers for up to 4 years. The average
                            interval between births for a female gorilla is four to six years.</p>

                        <p class="info-row-text">Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush tropical forest of west
                            and central Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its diet grow best where the
                            open canopy allows plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests also
                            contain a much higher diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in particular fruit, than
                            mountainous habitats. Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the ground and build
                            sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees for the night.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-row">
                        <h3 class="info-row-heading">Diet:</h3>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on plant
                            parts including seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and flowers; however, they prefer fruit
                            whenever it’s in season. Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants, as a
                            supplement to their diet when they are readily available. Due to their dietary preferences,
                            western lowland gorillas spend a lot of their time in and around trees, especially fruit
                            trees. Even large males can sometimes be found up in the trees, but they are careful to stay
                            near a main trunk or on larger branches that are able to support their weight. Younger,
                            lighter gorillas may climb higher in trees, even swinging freely from branch to branch.
                            Gorillas never completely strip vegetation from a single area; rather, the rapid regrowth of
                            the vegetation they consume allows them to stay within a reasonable confined home range for
                            extended periods of time..</p>
                        <p class="info-row-text">Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of fruits and vegetables to our
                            western lowland gorillas. These include apples, oranges, bananas, raisins, sweet potatoes,
                            cabbage, collards, and primate chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are chopped up and
                            <a href="">scattered</a> around the habitat. From there, the gorillas come outside and forage for their
                            food as they would in the wild. Browse foods including bamboo, banana leaves, mulberry, elm
                            and willow are also <a href="">scattered</a> in their habitat.</p>
